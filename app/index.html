      <h2>About our crew</h2>
      <p>Our President is Zaphod Beeblebrox, also the President of the Galaxy. He was voted &ldquo;Worst dressed Sentient Being in the Known Universe&rdquo; seven consecutive times. His brain is fuelled by lemons, but has good hunches.</p>
      <p>Ford Prefect is from a planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and a semi half cousin of Zaphod Beeblebrox. They share three of the same mothers, and both favor the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. Marvin is a robot with an exceptionally large brain, and built in GPP, which stands for Genuine People Personality. He is always happy and eager to help. Or is he? Arthur Dent is an Englishman, who happened to be friends with Ford Prefect, who happened to choose to take Arthur to the Galactic ride. Tricia McMillan, or Trillian, which sound more spacey, is also a human, who happened to meet Arthur and Zaphod at the same fancy dress party on Earth, but choose to check out Zaphod&lsquo;s spaceship instead.</p>
      <p>Humma Kavula is a political rival of Zaphod Beeblebrox, who just happens to be in the picture, but it might turn out as a good campain catch for Zaphod.</p>

      <h3>Arthur Dent</h3>
      <h3>First Hitchhiker</h3>
      <p>&ldquo;I happened to hitch my first ever ride, because of my friend, Ford Prefect. I did not know that he was an alien at that time, but did not bother me at all. I had a real life changing experience. Just a friendly advice, if I may. Always have a towel!&rdquo;</p>

      <h3>Dirk Gently</h3>
      <h3>Holistic Detective</h3>
      <p>&ldquo;I am from a completely different story, but since I am a holistic detective, who thinks that everything in the Universe is interconnected, and also the stories above seem to prove me right, so why not hitch a ride..&rdquo;</p>

      <h3>Douglas Adams</h3>
      <h3>Writer</h3>
      <p>&ldquo;If there is a Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Europe, then why not have one to the Galaxy? Although crazy things can happen to You wherever You are. Just travel a lot, and please do not under any circumstances forget to have a towel with You! And also, DON&rsquo;T PANIC!&rdquo;</p>
