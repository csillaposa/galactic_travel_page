          <p>Our President is Zaphod Beeblebrox, also the President of the Galaxy. He was voted &ldquo;Worst dressed Sentient Being in the Known Universe&rdquo; seven consecutive times. His brain is fuelled by lemons, but has good hunches.</p>
          <p>Ford Prefect is from a planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and a semi half cousin of Zaphod Beeblebrox. They share three of the same mothers, and both favor the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. Marvin is a robot with an exceptionally large brain, and built in Genuine People Personality. He is always happy and eager to help. Or is he? Arthur Dent is an Englishman, who happened to be friends with Ford Prefect, who happened to choose to take Arthur to the Galactic ride. Tricia McMillan, or Trillian, which sound more spacey.She is also a human, who happened to meet Arthur and Zaphod at the same fancy dress party on Earth, and happened to choose to check out Zaphod&lsquo;s spaceship.</p>
          <p>Humma Kavula is a political rival of Zaphod Beeblebrox, who just happens to be in the picture, but it might turn out as a good campain catch for Zaphod.</p>
